<p><a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#History"><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong></a> is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language[a]</a>for documents designed to be displayed in a <a href="">web browser</a>. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href="">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>  and <a href="">scripting languages</a> such as <a href="">JavaScript,</a> a programming language.</p>
<p><a href="">Web browsers</a>receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and <a href="">render</a> the documents into multimedia <a href="">web pages</a>. HTML describes the structure of a web page <a href="">semantically</a> and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
<p><a href="">HTML elements</a> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <a href="">images</a> and other objects such as <a href="">interactive forms</a> may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural <a href="">semantics</a> for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as < img >and <  input  > directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as < p > and <  /p  > surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
